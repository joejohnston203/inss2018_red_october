    "The goal of this project is to determine the feasibiliy of detecting the presence of a nuclear submarine through the detection of neutrinos produced by its reactor. We will assume the nuclear submarine operates at a maximum of 150 MW at full speed of 45 knots and reactor power is proportional to speed. Acheives maximal depth of 300 m. We will also assume that the $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux from the reactor only comes from fission of $^{235}U$. Then we can compute the expected flux for a water cherenkov detector at a distance of 500 m as a function of neutrino energy:"
